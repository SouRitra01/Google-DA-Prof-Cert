However, increasing the sample size by adding another data could help to address the limitation of small data size. Furthermore, the content section of the dataset mentioned that ‘Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data’, further investigation and exploration is needed to find out the criteria for being ‘eligible’ users to the submission of the personal tracker data.\n\n- Original The datasets are third party information from public domain by Mobius, not originally by the service provider, Amazon Mechanical Turk.
